This was my first time ever creating a game. It turned out looking and feeling pretty good (IMHO). It's not feature complete, but it's playable:

- Tilt the device to move the character sideways.
- Tap on the screen to shoot web.
- If you hit a bird with your web, it will fall from the skies.
- If a bird touches the character, it will fall from the skies.

What I've used:

- `CoreMotion` SDK to taking advantage of iPhone's accelerometer.
- `SpriteKit` SDK to render graphics, animations and detecting collision with physics.
